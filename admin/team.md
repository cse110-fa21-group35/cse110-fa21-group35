# Branding

We chose to use the icon of an egg as our team mascot and named our team _Eggcellent_.

Heyo! I’m Logan Ramos and I am a 3rd-year majoring in mathematics-computer science. Summer of 2021 I interned on the API Services team at Disney Streaming in a small experimental group called the Fraud Squad, where I contributed to their automated fraud detection (service for Disney+, ESPN+, Star+, MLB TV, and soon Hulu). Recently I’ve been fascinated about category theory and its relationship to type classes (FP related). If I’m not working or contributing, I’m likely surfing or contemplating my life. Omelettes are amazing with bell peppers.
