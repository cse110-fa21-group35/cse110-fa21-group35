4. Method for setting and following meeting agendas:
   - Who will set each agenda and when?
     - Everyone can propose an agenda by editing the minutes.
     - If someone has issues with the proposed agenda, we can sort that out at the beginning of the meeting.
   - Standup agenda
     - Everyone has their own portion of the agenda:
       - What you did since the last meeting:
       - What went well?
       - What are you working on right now/focus?
       - Blockers?
   - What will be done to keep the team on track during a meeting?
     - We will rely on each individual team member to stop the conversation from going too informal.
     - We will also add an “estimate time” for each item on the agenda that we will try to adhere to.
5. Method of record keeping (meeting minutes):
   - Each meeting minutes will be kept as a Markdown file in our group repository (/admin/meetings).
   - The recording keeping will alternate between each member so that every member could equally participate in each meeting.
   - Each meeting minutes will be labeled by date and topics and will include:
     - The type of meeting.
     - Attendance list.
     - Time/place.
     - Agenda.
     - Items for future investigation.
     - Decisions made and discussions with key points/reasoning .

### Team Expectations

#### Work Quality

1. Project standards:
   - If your code does not work, do not push it to master
   - Work on stuff on your own branch.
   - Comment your code clearly.
   - Clear communication.
   - Each team member put effort into their portion of the project and group assignments.
   - 2 approvals: first by another team member, then team lead approves before merging.
2. Strategies to fulfill these standards
   - Set time to improve guidelines for integration.
   - Have set roles and cycle through if see fit.

### Team Participation

1. Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:
   - Distribute story points to each team member
     - Based on skills and situation of each team member
2. Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance):
   - During standups, each team member should comment/contribute.
   - If you feel like an idea isn’t optimal, before shooting it down, walkthrough their logic and find their confusion/lack of insight. Positively suggest alternatives!!! Do not be like “that sucks, this is better”.
   - Do not hesitate to share an idea.
3. Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):
   - Organize sprints and have regular standups.
   - Keep the ticketing system organized! (git issues, jira, etc.).
4. Preferences for leadership (informal, formal, individual, shared):
   - Each member should take the initiative to lead their role.
   - Informal between team leads and members, but still in a professional manner.
   - SHARED: We are all responsible for maintaining the quality of our code (e.g keep main clean).

### Personal Accountability

1. Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:
   - We expect each member to attend at least one meeting per week (either standup or Sunday meeting), but should communicate with the rest of the team via Slack when they will not be able to attend or be late.
     - Always update your portion of the standup (no exceptions).
   - Anyone who misses a meeting should read through the meeting minute on their own before the next meeting. If anything needs to be clarified, ask other members.
2. Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:
   - Commit early and commit often TO YOUR BRANCH.
   - Keep the deadlines (2-week sprint).
3. Expected level of communication with other team members:
   - For PR reviews, approvals need to be very thorough. No putting “LGTM!” and slapping an approval, if there’s something that can be done better point it out kindly.
   - Be communicative on slack.
4. Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.
   - Each team member should commit to team decision → majority rule

### Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations

1. Describe, as a group, you would handle infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:
   - Discuss the infraction and why
   - Two strike or three strike policy
2. Describe what your team will do if the infractions continue:
   - We would contact our TA(mentor) about the issue first then report to the Professor if further assistance is needed.
