- No branch protection rules so please do not push to main, even for 1 line changes make a branch called `NO-TICKET` and create a pull request.
- Do NOT merge a pull request if: it fails our CI checks, or is a major feature without any approvals.
- Additionally, try not to merge someone else's PR unless you were given permission (may not be done, plz don't break main).
