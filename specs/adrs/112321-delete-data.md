## Context and Problem Statement

1. How should we delete datas from our storage?

## Considered Options

1. If the action is to delete a recipe, essentially remove the associated recipe contents in firebase. In the app, we need two pieces of information: the respective account ID attempting to make the deletion, and the recipe ID which was chosen. Deleting would be removing the associated json of the recipeID inside the userâ€™s recipes object, which is identified by accountId.recipes. We will query our database accordingly.

## Decision Outcome

1. Query db with a delete for accountId.recipes.recipeId
